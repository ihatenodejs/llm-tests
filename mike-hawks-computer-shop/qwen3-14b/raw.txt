Okay, the user wants me to create a website for Mike Hawk's Computer Shop. The key point is that Mike refuses to repair computers with Windows installed because of a personal distaste. Let me start by brainstorming the structure and content.

First, the homepage needs a welcoming message that highlights Mike's stance. Maybe a bold headline to grab attention. Then, sections explaining why he doesn't repair Windows computers. I should make it clear but not offensive. Maybe add a bit of humor to keep it light, since personal distaste can come off as strong.

Next, services offered. He probably does repairs for other OS like macOS or Linux. Need to list those services, maybe with icons for visual appeal. Also, include other services like hardware upgrades or custom builds to show variety.

Testimonials would help build credibility. Maybe include quotes from customers who appreciate his no-nonsense approach. A FAQ section can address common questions, like why Windows is excluded and what alternatives he offers.

Contact info is essential. Form for inquiries, phone number, email, maybe social media links. Also, a footer with links to privacy policy and terms of service.

Design-wise, the user might want it clean and professional. Maybe a dark theme with neon accents to give a techy vibe. Use some icons for services and ensure the site is responsive.

Wait, need to make sure the tone isn't too confrontational. Mike's distaste is personal, so phrasing it as a preference rather than a judgment. Maybe add something about respecting customer choices but sticking to his expertise.

Also, include a note that he's open to discussing alternatives or recommendations for Windows users. That way, it's not a hard no but a clear boundary.

Check if there are any legal considerations. Refusing service based on OS might have implications, but since it's a small shop, probably okay as long as it's clearly stated.

Alright, putting it all together with HTML and CSS. Make sure the code is clean, uses semantic tags, and is easy to customize later. Maybe add some JavaScript for the contact form if needed, but keep it simple.
