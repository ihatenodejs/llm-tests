<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to create a website for "Mike Hawk's Computer Shop" with the detail that Mike refuses to repair computers with Windows installed, due to a personal distaste. The user is asking us to "Create a website for 'Mike Hawk's Computer Shop.'" We need to produce HTML/CSS (and maybe JavaScript) code for a website. The site likely includes a homepage, about page, services page (including the Windows refusal), contact page. The user might want a simple website design with some placeholder content, but must include the specific detail that Mike refuses to repair Windows computers. Also we might want to incorporate a tagline or note about the policy. Possibly we could add some humor, but maintain professionalism.

We need to output a complete website code that can be used as static files. We could create index.html, about.html, services.html, contact.html. Or we can embed all content in a single file using sections or navigation. But better to produce multiple files for clarity.

The user might want a responsive design with CSS, maybe using Bootstrap. But we could write custom CSS.

We should also include a note about Windows refusal, maybe in the services page. Possibly mention that they only repair macOS and Linux computers. Also could mention a policy statement on the homepage.

We should also incorporate contact form or at least phone number and email.

Also maybe add a small style: color scheme, fonts. We can use some simple CSS. Might also include images placeholders.

We might want to create a folder structure: index.html, about.html, services.html, contact.html, css/style.css, images/... But we can't actually create files; but we can provide code for each file.

Thus the answer should contain:

- index.html
- about.html
- services.html
- contact.html
- css/style.css

Also maybe mention that the images folder contains placeholder images.

We should also note the Windows refusal policy. We need to include it prominently, maybe in a banner.

We should also incorporate navigation with links to all pages.

Also we might want a small script for form submission (maybe just placeholder). But not necessary.

We need to think about the best approach: Provide code blocks for each file. The user can copy-paste into files.

Also we should include meta tags, title.

We need to ensure the code is valid HTML5. Use semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>.

Also include a style that sets colors: maybe dark background, light text. For example, use #2c3e50 for header, #ecf0f1 for body. Or something else.

Also we can incorporate icons or logos: maybe use a placeholder text "Mike Hawk's Computer Shop".

We should also include a small disclaimer or statement: "We do not repair computers with Windows installed."

Also maybe mention "We specialize in macOS and Linux repairs." And perhaps a small FAQ.

Ok, let's draft the code. We'll produce index.html with header and navigation, main content with hero section, about snippet, services preview, contact preview. We'll link to other pages.

We'll include a banner or notice: "Note: We do not repair computers with Windows installed."

Let's produce the CSS. Use a simple responsive design: media queries for small screens.

Also include minimal JavaScript if needed, but likely not necessary.

Ok, let's produce the code:

- index.html: includes navigation to about.html, services.html, contact.html. Use <a href="about.html">About</a> etc.

- about.html: includes detailed info about Mike, his background, mission. Also mention the Windows refusal.

- services.html: list of services: hardware repair, software installation (macOS/Linux), troubleshooting, upgrades. And note that Windows computers are not accepted.

- contact.html: includes contact form with name, email, message. Use method="post" action="#" (just placeholder). Also include phone and email.

- style.css: set base styles, header background color, navigation layout, responsive adjustments. Use simple typography.

We also need to mention "Mike refuses to repair computers with Windows installed, due to a personal distaste." So we must include that in the text.

Also maybe mention "If you need Windows repairs, please contact another shop." or something like that.

Ok, let's write the code. Use <meta charset="utf-8"> etc.

Add a favicon? Not necessary.

We might want to mention the website uses "Roboto" or similar fonts. But we can keep it simple.

Ok, let's start writing the code for index.html:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Mike Hawk's Computer Shop</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Mike Hawk's Computer Shop</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="services.html">Services</a></li>
          <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </div>
  </header>

  <section class="hero">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Reliable Repairs for macOS & Linux</h2>
      <p>We specialize in troubleshooting, hardware upgrades, and software solutions for Apple and Linux systems. Windows computers are not serviced.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <main class="container">
    <h3>Why Choose Us?</h3>

    <h3>Services Preview</h3>
    <ul class="services-list">
      <li>Hardware diagnostics & repair</li>
      <li>macOS & Linux software installation</li>
      <li>System optimization & clean-up</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="services.html" class="btn">View All Services</a></p>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <div class="container">
      <p>&copy; 2025 Mike Hawk's Computer Shop. All rights reserved.</p>
    </div>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Add the CSS accordingly.

Ok, next about.html:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>About - Mike Hawk's Computer Shop</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
...
```

Then include Mike's background, mention Windows refusal. Provide a small quote.

Next services.html: list of services and detail about Windows refusal:

```
<h1>Our Services</h1>
<p>At Mike Hawk's Computer Shop, we offer a full range of repair and support services for macOS and Linux computers. Please note: We do not repair or service computers that have Windows installed due to personal policy.</p>
...
```

Add list of services, each with description.

Next contact.html: include a simple form. Add phone and email details.

Also we might want to add some placeholder images? We can mention "images/hero.jpg" etc.

Ok, let's produce the CSS. Use a minimal design:

- Body: background color #f9f9f9, font-family sans-serif.

- Header: background color #2c3e50, color #ecf0f1.

- Navigation: horizontal list.

- .hero: background image or color.

- Buttons: style.

- Footer: small text.

Add responsive styles for mobile. Use @media (max-width: 600px) to stack nav items vertically.

Ok, let's produce the CSS:

```
/* style.css */
body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  color: #333;
}
.container {
  width: 90%;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: auto;
}
header {
  background-color: #2c3e50;
  color: #ecf0f1;
}
header h1 {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px 0;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
}
nav ul {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: flex;
}
nav li {
  margin-left: 20px;
}
nav a {
  color: #ecf0f1;
  text-decoration: none;
  padding: 10px 0;
}
nav a:hover {
  border-bottom: 2px solid #ecf0f1;
}
.hero {
  background-color: #34495e;
  color: #ecf0f1;
  padding: 60px 0;
}
.hero h2 {
  margin-top: 0;
}
main {
  padding: 40px 0;
}
.services-list {
  list-style: disc inside;
}
.btn {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: #2980b9;
  color: #fff;
  text-decoration: none;
}
.btn:hover {
  background-color: #1f639b;
}
footer {
  background-color: #2c3e50;
  color: #ecf0f1;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px 0;
}
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  nav ul {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
  }
  nav li {
    margin-left: 0;
    margin-top: 10px;
  }
}
```

Also maybe add more styling for forms.

Ok, contact form:

```
<form action="#" method="post" class="contact-form">
  <label for="name">Name</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
  ...
```

Add CSS for form.

Ok, let's produce the code. Provide all files in separate sections. Use triple backticks with language annotation for each file.

Also we should mention the policy: "We do not repair Windows computers due to personal distaste." It could be included in about page, services page.

Ok, let's produce the final answer.<|end|>
