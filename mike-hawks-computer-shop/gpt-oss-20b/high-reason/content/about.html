  <h2>About Mike Hawk</h2>
  <p>Mike grew up tinkering with computers in his parents’ garage. After earning a degree in Computer Science, he opened his own shop to provide honest and affordable repair services for the community.  
  Mike’s specialty? Apple & Linux machines – he refuses to work on any computer that has Windows installed, because “Windows just doesn’t fit the vibe.”</p>

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <ul class="services-list">
    <li>Fast, transparent repairs</li>
    <li>High‑quality parts and tools</li>
    <li>Education: teach customers how to keep their systems healthy</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Looking for a reliable partner who respects your operating system? Mike’s got you covered.</p>
