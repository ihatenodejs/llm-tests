Okay, let me start by figuring out how to approach creating a website for Mike Hawk's Computer Shop. The main thing here is that Mike doesn't repair computers with Windows installed because of his personal distaste. So I need to make sure that the website clearly communicates this policy right from the homepage.

First, I should brainstorm what sections are essential for a computer repair shop website. The typical pages would include Home, Services, About Us, Testimonials, Contact Info, maybe FAQs. Let me think about each section.

The homepage needs to be catchy and immediately state Mike's stance against repairing Windows computers. Maybe a bold header like "Computers Without Windows, Repaired Without Compromise." Then some subtext explaining his dedication to open-source systems like Linux.

For Services, since Mike doesn't repair Windows computers, he must offer other services. Let me think‚Äîrepair services could include hardware repairs like laptop screen replacement, virus removal for non-Windows systems, data recovery, system upgrades, hardware installations (RAM, SSDs), diagnostics. Maybe also offer support for Linux distributions or other OS alternatives?

The About Us page should tell Mike's story‚Äîhis distaste for Windows, maybe his background in computer repair and open-source advocacy. Emphasize integrity, transparency. Maybe a personal note from Mike explaining why he refuses Windows repairs‚Äîsomething like ethical reasons related to monopolies or closed-source software?

Testimonials could highlight positive experiences customers have had with Mike's service on their Linux machines or macOS devices.

Contact Info needs a form, email address, phone number, business address maybe? Also operating hours if applicable.

FAQ section could answer questions like why Mike refuses Windows repairs, what OS he supports, cost estimates, etc.

Now designing the layout‚Äîprobably responsive design using HTML/CSS with maybe Bootstrap or TailwindCSS? But since it's a basic site, maybe simple CSS suffices.

The homepage banner could prominently display Mike's stance. Then a hero section explaining services briefly with buttons leading deeper into the site.

Need visuals‚Äîmaybe some images related to computer repair tools, Linux terminal screens since Mike advocates open-source OS.

Color scheme‚Äîprofessional yet friendly colors like blues and greens maybe? Avoid Windows' typical reds/whites.

Fonts‚Äîclean sans-serif fonts for readability.

Make sure the website is accessible compliant, responsive across devices.

Now considering SEO‚Äîkeywords like "computer repair," "Linux computer service," "Windows alternative repair," etc.

Also forms for contact, maybe newsletter sign-up if Mike wants updates on new services or events like Linux workshops?

Need to ensure that the site emphasizes Mike's expertise outside Windows repairs and positions him as trustworthy specialist in alternative systems.

Possible error checking‚Äîredirect customers with Windows computers politely to alternatives or suggest transferring data and switching OS. But Mike refuses repairs‚Äîso maybe he declines service politely but states his policy clearly upfront.

Legal stuff‚Äîprivacy policy, terms of service linked in footer?

Also maybe include social media links if Mike has any profiles related to the business.

Wait, user didn't specify backend requirements‚Äîdoes Mike need appointment booking system? Maybe a contact form suffices initially, with follow-up emails.

Okay, putting all together into HTML/CSS structure. Let me outline the structure in HTML first with placeholders for content sections.

Need to ensure that each section flows logically from homepage highlighting Mike's policy, then services details explaining exactly what he offers excluding Windows repairs.

Also think about testimonials‚Äîmaybe customers appreciate transparency and expertise beyond just repair services, like guidance towards better OS options.

Alright, putting all these thoughts into structure. Maybe start coding HTML/CSS with sections Home/Services/About/Testimonials/Contact, styled appropriately.
