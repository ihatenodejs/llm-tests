        <div class="disclaimer">
            <strong>Important Note:</strong> Due to a personal distaste for the Windows operating system and its constant security issues, Mike Hawk's Computer Shop refuses to repair computers with Windows installed. We believe in providing the best service for systems that we know and trust.
