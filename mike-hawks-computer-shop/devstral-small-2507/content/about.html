        <h1>About Mike</h1>
        <p>Mike Hawk has been working with computers since the early 90s, starting with his first Apple IIc. He developed a passion for computers that are reliable and user-friendly, which led him to specialize in Mac and Linux systems.</p>
        <p>After years of working in various tech roles, Mike decided to open his own shop where he could focus on providing excellent service for the systems he believes in.</p>
        <p>His personal distaste for Windows systems comes from his belief that computers should be tools that empower users, not frustrate them with constant updates and security issues.</p>
