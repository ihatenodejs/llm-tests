# The Tests

## Mike Hawk's Computer Shop

This is one of my older prompts, originally called Qwen's Computer Shop, which tests the model's ability to infer instructions, and of course, it's design/code generation capabilities.

In this test, I like to pay attention to the model's understanding of CSS in ways such as:

1. Does the model understand that some elements, depending on their padding/margin, may cover other elements?
2. Does the model design a header, footer, and a valuable amount of content (such as explaining the services Mike offers, the pricing, and his policy against Windows)?
3. If present, did the model include a good-looking, non-distracting animation?

Some models will also output a `.js` file for contact form validation. I did not think of this at the time of creating this test, but I now prefer models who included this.
